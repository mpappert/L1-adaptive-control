# Robust L1-adaptive control of a planar nanopositioning system under model uncertainties and disturbances (Master Thesis)
This master thesis deals with the investigation, selection and design of suitable adaptive control methods
for a planar nanopositioning system. For this purpose, controllers of the L1-adaptive control theory, a
novel theory for adaptive control, are considered and compared with conventional adaptive controllers,
such as the MRAC. The disturbances and uncertainties acting on the nanopositioning system are
described and an L1-adaptive state feedback and an L1-adaptive output feedback controller are
designed. Finally, these are enhanced to develop a dynamic trajectory tracking controller.
